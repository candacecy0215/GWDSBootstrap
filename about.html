      <h2>About WOK with You</h2>
      <p class="About">
      Welcome to "WOK with You," where passion for food meets dedication to community.</p>

      <p class="About">Founded by newlyweds Mindy and Mike, "WOK with You" is more than just a restaurant; 
        it's a manifestation of our shared values and commitment to making a positive impact.</p>
      
      <p class="About">
        Our journey began with a vision to tackle the pressing issue of food waste in our community. 
        Drawing from Mindy's family background in sustainable farming and Mike's expertise in culinary arts, 
        we set out to create a space where every ingredient is cherished and every meal tells a story of resilience and resourcefulness.
      </p>

      <p class="About">At "WOK with You," we believe in the power of food to bring people together and create meaningful connections. 
        Our menu is a fusion of Asian-inspired flavors and locally sourced ingredients, 
        carefully crafted to delight your taste buds while minimizing our environmental footprint.

      </p>

      <p class="About">But our vision extends far beyond the confines of our kitchen. 
      We believe that everyone deserves access to nourishing food, 
      regardless of their financial circumstances. 
      That's why we offer a "Pay As You Feel" Fresh Food Box subscription, 
      brimming with rescued treasures from local supermarkets and farmers' markets, 
      available for collection at select pick-up locations across the city.</p>
      
      <p class="About">
        Central to our mission is our "Pay As You Feel" concept, which reflects our belief that everyone deserves access to nourishing food, 
        regardless of their financial circumstances. Whether you're able to contribute financially, volunteer your time, or simply share in the joy of a meal with us, 
        your support helps us make a difference in the lives of others.
        
      </p>
      
      <p class="About">
    
        We're dedicated to fostering a community of compassion and sustainability, 
        where every guest is welcomed with open arms and every meal is an opportunity to make a positive impact.
      </p>
      

      <p class="About">Join us as we redefine the meaning of food waste and foster a community of compassion and sustainability, 
      one plate at a time. Welcome to a dining experience where every stir-fry is a celebration of unity and every dish is cooked with love. 
      Together, let's wok towards a brighter, more inclusive future for all.
